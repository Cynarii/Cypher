# Cypher
This is a code cracking python script I created. In its current state it can crack ciphertext that is encoded in Atbash, Caesar,  and ROT13 ciphers. In the future I plan to add more to this project.

Usage: python3 cypher.py -ct [ciphertext] -m [method]

Using cypher.py, you supply your ciphertext, or encrypted text, in the -ct parameter (to add spaces, simply use /) and the method that you want to use.

The methods that are included are Atbash, Caesar and Rot13.

Atbash:
