# Cypher
This is a code cracking python script I created. In its current state it can crack ciphertext that is encoded in Atbash, Caesar,  and ROT13 ciphers. In the future I plan to add more to this project.

Usage: python3 cypher.py -ct [ciphertext] -m [method]

Using cypher.py, you supply your ciphertext, or encrypted text, in the -ct parameter
